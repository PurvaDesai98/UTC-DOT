        <p>Discover: The discoveries and inventions developed through CYBER-CARE research are key to technology transfer. However, to ensure the high value and practicality of the research, research topics must be identified and selected based on close industry–university collaboration. Our existing Industry Innovation Partnership program promotes such collaboration through industry needs analysis, a seed funding program, and rich networking opportunities that connect researchers with industry partners. We will expand the program to include a transportation system cybersecurity focus area and a project Evaluation Committee, including technical experts from both academia and industry, who will ensure that proposal selection balances knowledge advancement and practical industry needs. 

           <br><br> Evaluate: Upon research completion, the Evaluation Committee will evaluate the quality of each study, with a particular focus on reproducibility, to reduce the chance of transfer failure. Furthermore, each Center partner’s Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) will continue to evaluate the research outcomes for novelty, patentability, and potential future market value. Accordingly, the OTT will advise researchers on technology transfer strategies (e.g., patenting and publishing) and intellectual property (IP) protection and offer assistance with patent applications, as needed. 
            
            <br> <br> Market: We will increase public awareness of the Center’s research, which will lead to further technology transfer opportunities. In addition to offering strategic direction advice, the planned External Advisory Board will advise on outreach initiatives to improve Center visibility and industry and community engagement. The board consists of renowned experts from local and state government, business, academia, and finance. Industry associations and chambers of commerce representing women and minority-owned businesses, especially those from historically underserved neighborhoods, will be given particular consideration. We will coordinate existing outreach and marketing initiatives from each partner university, combining similar initiatives from center partners to increase awareness among transportation professionals through a wide range of activities to improve community outreach and engagement. Past efforts included “Tech demo,” “Community talk,” and “Roadshow,” in addition to traditional efforts, such as presentations, panel discussions, internet marketing, e-newsletters, and social media postings. 
            
           <br> <br> Operate: This stage employs a variety of best practices and cutting-edge programs to encourage knowledge transfer and information sharing. The Center will provide technical assistance with conventional publications (e.g., papers, reports, and presentations), training, and continuing education (e.g., academic and certificate programs), as well as invited talks, webinars, student internships, and faculty residencies. The OTT will support researchers with licensing and contract negotiations, commercial partner selection, and revenue management, as needed. </p>
